** Stages
- Vertex Shader => Geometry Shader => Shape/Primitive Assembly => Rasterization => 
  => Fragment Shader => Tests & Blending

** Explanation
   - Stage 1:
    - single vertex -> 'Vertex Shader'
    - Transform 3D coordinates into differed 3D coordinates
    - do basic processing on vertex attributes
    - The advantage of using VBO is that


   - collection of vertices that form a primitive -> 'Geometry Shader'

   - all of vertices from either vertex shader or geometry shader, that form
     one or more primitives and assembles all the points in the primitive 
     shape given => primitive assembly

   - output of primtive assembly => rasterization stage
     Here it maps the resulting primitives to the corresponding pixels on screen

   - rasterization stage outputs fragments
   - clipping is done 
   - then fragments are passed onto fragment shader 
   - fragment shader calculates the final color of a pixel, it does this by using 
     all the data it has: lights, shadows, color of lights, etc.

   - after all color values are determined, the final object passes through 'alpha test'
     and 'blending stage'
   - checks for alpha vlaues and blends objects accordingly
   - checks the corresponding depth & stencil value, and checks if resulting fragments are 
     behind other objects and if so discards accordingly
